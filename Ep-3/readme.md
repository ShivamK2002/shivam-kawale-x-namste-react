# Project Notes README

React.createElement creates an object that gets transformed as html when we render it.

for rendering it we need REACTDOM for browwers.
It will do DOM manipulation for us

JSX is not html inside javascript.
JSX is syntax but we can create React elements without it also

The primary goal is to write human understable code

Browsers can't understand jsx threfore it is transpiled by bundler so that browser/react can understand it.

The above process of transpiling is performed by babel(Js Compiler).

JSX code is converted to react code and then rendered as HTML

In Jsx you have give class as className
Camelcase syntax is used in jsx

If you wnat to write multipl linse of JSX then we have include it in "()"

React elements and components are different

componene composition is nothing but nesting of React components

JSX will santise js code inside it to avoid side scripting attac
